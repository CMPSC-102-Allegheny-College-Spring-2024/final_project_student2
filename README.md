## Project Goals

![logo](graphics/hands.png)  
Caption 1: You are invited to create a practical demonstration for Discrete Structures! Your topic can cover any concept from the course, or that should or could be in the course. Interestingly, demonstration ideas may come from all over mathematics but if you know how to program, then you are in a better position to be able to showcase them!

## Objectives

* To learn and understand a mathematical concept
* To learn and understand how to write the concept into computer code.
* To gain experience in communication while demonstrating concepts using code.

## Introduction

Throughout the semester in Discrete Structures, we have studied many computational artifacts ranging across mathematics, statistics, and basic models, in addition to other types of logical curiosities (noted below). For these lessons, we made clear connections between the theory and programming techniques. For instance, we took care to apply Python programming methods to demonstrate how to use their methods and calculations to reach results or complete calculations.

Artifacts:

- Variables: Integers, Floats, Booleans, Strings,
- Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples
- Monoids, Functions, lambda and higher-order functions
- Advanced: Finding square roots using functions, studying 3x+1 sequence convergence, calculating sequences using mathematical techniques in programming
- _And plenty of other really fascinating concepts!_

**In this final project**, you are given the opportunity to research some mathematical, statistical, or computational concept that has not been covered by our class. Here, you will explain the subject, motivation and provide some sample programming source code to demonstrate the artifact. You will present the artifact to the class to introduce, and explain and demonstrate the topic that you choose.

## Deliverables and Timeline

The below due dates cannot be extended. **Unfortunately, an assignment cannot be submitted after the deadline.**

The below deliverables are outlined below. In each, you will be expected to communicate your work (i.e., by writing or speaking) using clear and meaningful language.

- `writing/proposal.md`: Create a team and complete proposal of study. Discuss relevance to Discrete Structures.
  - Due by the end of class; **10:50 am on Wednesday, April 17th, 2024**

- **Presentation** to be given in class. The presentation comes before the due date of the project and is to provide an idea about the progression and motivations of your project. Please use slides and leave about eight minutes for a rehearsed presentation. 
  - Presentations are given during (last) lab time, **Monday, April 29nd, 2024, at 2:30 pm - 4:20 pm**

- `writing/researchNotebook.md`: The Research Notebook is to be an active record and log of all the main activities of your group to accomplish tasks. This document contains all references for the resources that were used in your project including; articles, code sources, data and similar. Please include a note about who is to complete which step.
  - Due on **9:00 am on Monday, May 6th, 2024** (Firm deadline: No extensions are possible)

- `writing/report.md`: Final report due. In this report, you are to provide an overview of your research question(s), steps, two or three peer-reviewed citations, code, screenshots, and other types of information to help explain your project. Assume that your reader is unfamiliar with your work as you introduce and explain your project.
  - Due on **9:00 am on Monday, May 6th, 2024** (Firm deadline: No extensions are possible)

## Research Task

Each week our lessons, assessments, and activities made clear connections between the mathematical concepts, with those from Computer Science by using demonstrations. These demonstrations were written in Python code and allowed the members of the class to see and understand mathematical methods at play in computer code. In addition to learning the mechanisms behind the computation, students were given opportunities to learn and practice better code writing skills for Python.

To create these demonstrations for lessons in the course, it was first necessary to conduct some meaningful research in basic mathematics to be able to connect a concept to some structure in Computer Science.

In this final project, you are invited to __work as a group__ of two or three members, to complete similar research in mathematics to create an interesting demonstration for the class. In particular, you are to find some mathematical quality, mechanism, equation, function, or a similar construct from mathematics, that can be modeled and demonstrated in Python code.

### Individual Tasks

The tasks of the project are the following.

- **Literature Review**: Find something worth a demonstration by reading mathematical articles, online sites, Wikipedia and etc. Once you have found the mathematical concept, learn how it works so that you may demonstrate the concept by reproducing its logic through computer code. If there are unusual cases involved, please be sure to learn some of them for your upcoming demonstration.
- **Programming a Demonstration**: Once you have understood the principles behind your chosen mathematical concept so that you can teach it to your peers, begin work on writing computer code to showcase the concept. Be sure to make your code elegant and readable to facilitate comprehension.
- **Presentation**: Now that your code works to describe the concept, you are ready to present the concept and its associated code. Here you are to discuss the concept, and make it perfectly clear that mathematics behind the concept is absolutely fascinating. Next, you will run your Python code to show your colleagues the concept in action (in some way). This demonstration will be live, meaning that you will prepare your laptop to be able to run the demonstration in front of the class.
- **Research Notebook**: Outline your steps and the group members who handle the steps. Then be sure to discuss how the steps are relevant to the project.
- **Report**: Introduce, explain, and demonstrate your project in terms of its motivations, mathematical theory, computer programming, and demonstration. Please assume that your reader is unfamiliar with the subject matter.

### Sample Research Questions

Potential research questions may be comparable to the following:

- We studied sequence convergence of the _3XPlus1_ system of equations. Can you change the rules in some way to demonstrate what happens?
- Sequences of numbers were a focus in the class. Can you find an interesting sequence (i.e., Fibonacci, Lucas, or other types of sequences) to demonstrate?
- Can you look up a Prime number tester by [Miller and Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test) to implement some computer code to demonstrate how it works?
- Can you find some other logic-driven system to implement in Python code for a demonstration?

### Working as a Group

- As much of the work in Computer Science is in teams, you must work in a group. You can choose your own team members or join an existing group.
- Group size: up to three people only.
- Before you begin, you must decide who will be in your group. Once you have put together your group, click on the assignment link given in class. In group assignments, only one person will be creating the team while the other team members will join that team. To establish the team name, please use the `Create a new team` option after accepting the assignment.
- Please work collaboratively and leave no one "out of the loop" of project work and updates. Please note that working in groups is one of the best ways to add value to project since you can brainstorm ideas and develp them together.

## Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up to 5%]:** For the project repository associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes. This is only checking some baseline writing and commit requirements as well as correct inclusion of files. An additional reduction will be given if the commit log shows a cluster of commits at the end clearly used just to pass this requirement. An addition reduction will also be given if there is no commit during lab or class project work times. All other requirements are evaluated manually.

- **Mastery of technical Skills [up to 35%]:**: Students will also receive these points when their project demonstrates proficiency in posing, understanding, and correctly responding to Discrete Structures question(s). A part of this grade is based on the responses to the writing questions presented in the `report.md`. The submitted writing should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate answers. Additionally, all steps of the inquiry must be clearly demonstrated and all visual output must be included in the report.

- **Research Notebook [Up 15%]:** A log of your steps toward the completion of the project.  This should include detailed explanations of what and who completed each step.

- **Computer Code [up to 30%]:** Students are to submit working computer code in the File `source/artifact.py`. If you require other files in your demonstration, please design and implement your code so that your entire project can be executed with the command; `python artifact.py` or `python3 artifact.py`. Note: all included data must be hardcoded in your computer code to enable the above execution command to run your code.

- **Mastery of Oral Communication [up to 15%]:** Groups will receive a portion of their assignment grade when the presentation shows a complete understanding of the completed work and ability to communicate its ideas. Each member of the team must provide some spoken part of the presentation.
